# Proxie App

## Description
Proxie is a social networking app designed to foster meaningful connections through location-based interactions. Leveraging Firebase for authentication, messaging, and data storage, the app features a battery-efficient real-time geolocation algorithm that redefines the way users interact. This innovative approach ensures privacy at greater distances while seamlessly notifying users as they come within proximity, striking a balance between personal safety and spontaneous connection.  



Proxie seeks to inspire users to message one another, meet in person, and engage in meaningful conversations, breaking away from the isolating trends of modern social media. By encouraging users to step away from their screens and connect face-to-face, Proxie aligns itself with the U.S. Surgeon General's call to address the epidemic of loneliness. This app is not just a tool but a statementâ€”a vision to redirect the trajectory of technology toward fostering genuine human connection and social well-being.

### 8. Geolocation Optimization for Battery Efficiency
- **Battery Concerns**:
  - Significant focus was placed on minimizing battery usage since the app continuously tracks location, even in the background or when the app is closed.
- **Efficient Geolocation Algorithm**:
  - The tracking algorithm adjusts location accuracy based on proximity:
    - For friends at far distances: Rough location data is retrieved using low-power methods (e.g., cell tower triangulation).
    - As friends move closer: Location accuracy gradually increases.
    - Within the critical 750-foot radius: GPS accuracy is optimized to within a meter to ensure precise detection.
  - This adaptive system ensures accurate proximity detection while conserving battery life.


## Database Structure

## Roadmap
The next big feature planned for Proxie is the ability for users to add mediaâ€”up to two photos and one videoâ€”during a Proxie event. This media will be displayed in the **Diary Logs** for that specific event. The goal is to allow users to capture spontaneous memories while respecting privacy and fostering meaningful interactions.
